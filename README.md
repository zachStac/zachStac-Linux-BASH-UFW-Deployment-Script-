# zachStac-Linux-BASH-UFW-Deployment-Script-
Goal: Due to the act that most of my projects are built in some kind of a Linux environment, and with a great bunch of these being a VM instance, there was a need for a simple and effective way to deploy a fire wall and a set of rules. This is to learn about the IP tables system, and to explore other firewalls and systems. 

To Do:  
	Build a script to install UFW
	Add the ability to set the rules
	Add a clean CMD interface 
	Add any extra bits and components 
	Look in to combining an application white list function in to this area  
	Explore the kinds of fire walls for Linux using IP tables and other
	Try to build off of the IP tables to add custom functions. This part may collide with my IDS/IPS system project.
	Pen test the fire wall scrip to find undefined areas or existing threat vector insertion locations.
	

Project: 
•	I built a small out line of some of the basic things I want to have right off the bat. I will ned to conium to read into the functions of UFW, as I proceed there will most likely be other fire walls to use.
